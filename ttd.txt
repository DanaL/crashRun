CURRENTLY WORKING ON
- Hacking doesn't appear to be using "get_hacking_bonus()"
- searching beside an already found bomb displays the reveal message again
- check GameLevel end_of_turn() and turn counting in DungeonMaster -- don't want to count turns more than once!
- extra space in message when playing stands on stack of items (ammo, etc)
- when exiting cyberspace, if the player might lose hps but takes 0, the "Attack does no damage" message is displayed

BUGS
- need a way to stop players from scumming for files in cyberspace
- if backpack is full, and player picks up an item that can stack with something in the player's backpack
	the game won't let you add it
- could use a "you are no longer stunned" messaged
- when monsters just stand there, it's 'cause they're scared and the pick-fleeing move stuff is probably fucking up
- LONG STANDING DISPLAY BUG

FEATURES/IDEAS/NOTES
- moving onto doors auto-opens them (maybe this can be an option?)
- five iron, bludgeoning weapon
- after a sufficient level of hacking, automatically know where stair nodes are?
	- or a data file that reveals location? 
- monsters need to know to avoid meatspace bombs
- 'D' to disarm traps and bombs
- reanimated mathematician (confuses/dazes the player with math and science babble, resistance based on chutzpah)
	- slim chance of improving player's math skills
- Ghosts-in-the-shell
- if dazed, pausing should (sometimes) make you stagger
- instant coffee
	- minor stimulant
	- can be given to unionized maintenance worker to pacify it
- when cameras enabled and SCP is alive, if player crosses security camera, chance of initiating lockdown
- DocBots, trolls and garbage collectors all say things to the player -- could probably refactor their
	talkie-talkie parts into an "interface".  Decorators?
- (p)ause and wait command
- Doors and Equipment have completely separate implementations and notions of damage, which is dumb
